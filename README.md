# Lab 4.2 Bird Styling

This is a basic html webpage dedicated to birdwatching. It isn't ment to be
much but looks nice.

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash

## Running

To run make sure to have some kind of live server application to run the
server. Then you can run the server in its way. For this I used:

``` bash
